    "# **LLM-BASED MEDIA RECOMMENDER SYSTEM**\n",

    "## **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a study exploring the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot recommendation engines across three media domains: anime, books, and movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use publicly available datasets from Kaggle containing metadata and synopses. The workflow for each domain is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The user provides a natural language prompt describing their current mood or preferences.\n",
    "2. We embed both the prompt and all item descriptions using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` from the SentenceTransformers library.\n",
    "3. Cosine similarity is computed between the user input and each item’s synopsis to shortlist the top 15 most relevant titles.\n",
    "4. These 15 items are passed as context to `gpt-3.5-turbo`, which selects and justifies one final recommendation.\n",
    "5. We evaluate the results using two cosine similarity scores:\n",
    "   - Between the user prompt and the recommended **synopsis**.\n",
    "   - Between the user prompt and the GPT-generated **justification/reasoning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to assess how well LLMs can perform personalized media recommendations without explicit training, using only natural language inputs and existing content metadata.\n",

      "\n",
      "However, the time that Frieren spends with her comrades is equivalent to merely a fraction of her life, which has lasted over a thousand years. When the party disbands after their victory, Frieren casually returns to her \"usual\" routine of collecting spells across the continent. Due to her different sense of time, she seemingly holds no strong feelings toward the experiences she went through.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the years pass, Frieren gradually realizes how her days in the hero's party truly impacted her. Witnessing the deaths of two of her former companions, Frieren begins to regret having taken their presence for granted; she vows to better understand humans and create real personal connections. Although the story of that once memorable journey has long ended, a new tale is about to begin.\n"

    "### **Why Cosine Similarity?** : \n",
    "Cosine similarity is a metric that measures how similar two vectors are, based on the angle between them. It’s widely used in natural language processing to compare text embeddings, like comparing a mood prompt to a book or movie synopsis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text is converted into vectors**\n",
    "   Using a model like `SentenceTransformer`, the input (e.g., \"I want something dark and emotional\") and a synopsis are transformed into high-dimensional vectors (embeddings). These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cosine similarity measures the angle**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A cosine of **1.0** means the vectors are pointing in the same direction → **perfect match**.\n",
    "   * A cosine of **0.0** means the vectors are orthogonal → **no similarity**.\n",
    "   * A cosine of **-1.0** means they're opposite → **completely different**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Formula**\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{cosine\\_similarity}(A, B) = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{\\|A\\| \\|B\\|}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * $A \\cdot B$ is the **dot product** of the vectors\n",
    "   * $\\|A\\|$ and $\\|B\\|$ are their magnitudes (lengths)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it’s useful for the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It helps **quantify** how well the LLM’s recommended synopsis matches the intent.\n",
    "* It provides an **objective metric** to compare different recommendation methods.\n",
    "* It can be used to **evaluate accuracy** even when there’s no labeled ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, a **higher cosine similarity score** (closer to 1) means the anime/book/movie recommendation is semantically close to what the user said they wanted, even if the words used are different.\n"
